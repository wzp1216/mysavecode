A private conversation
Last week I went to the theatre(cinema). I had a very good seat.The Play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loundy. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors.
I turned round. I looked the man and the woman angrily.They did not pay attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again."I can't hear a word!" I said agnrily.
  'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely. 'This is a private conversation!'

Breakfast or lunch
It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday,I got up very late.I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.' Just then, the telephone rang.It was my aunt Lucy. 'I have just arrived by train!' She said. ‘I'm coming to see you.'
'But I am still having (eating--X) breakfast.'I said.
'What are you doing?' she asked.
'I'm having breakfast.'I repeated.
'Dear me.'she said. 'Do you always get up so late?It's one o'clock!'
