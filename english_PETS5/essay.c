Youth
{
    Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind;it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple nkees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.
    Youth menas a temperamental predominanec of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the lov of ease.
