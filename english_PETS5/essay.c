Youth


Youth()
{
    Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind;it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple nkees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.
    Youth menas a temperamental predominanec of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This is often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.
    Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-disturust bows the heat and turns the spirit back th dust.
    Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonders, the unfailing appetite for what's next and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart, there is a wireless station; so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, courage and power from man and from the infinite, so long as you are young.
    when your aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you've grown old, even at 20; but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there's hope you may die young at 80.

Three_Days_to_See()
{
    All of us have read thrilling stories in which the hero had only a limited and specified time to live. Sometimes it was as long as a year, sometimes as short as 24 hours. But always we were interested im discovering just how the doomed hero chose to spend his last days or his last hours. I speak, of course of free men who have a choice, not condemend criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited.
    Such stories set us thinking, wondering what we should do under similar circumstances. What events, what experiencds, what associations shouldwe crowd into those last hours as mortal beings,what regrets?
    Sometimes Ihave thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we sould die tomorrow. Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life.We should live each day with gentleness, vigor and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost when time stretches befor us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come. There are those, of course, who would adopt the Epicurean motto of "Eat, drink and be merry". But most people would be chastened by the certainty of impending death.
    In sotries the dommed hero is usually saved at the last minute by some stroke of fortune, but almost always his sene of values is changed. He becomes mor appreciative of the meaning of life and its permanent spiritual values. It has often been noted that those who live or have lived, in the shadow of death bring a mellow sweetness to everything they do.
